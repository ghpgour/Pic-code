I am hoping to put together an instructable for this hardware - but its taking a ridiculous amount of time.   
So in the meantime, here's a video of the code running on the display module.

Features...
  * Nixie = 1N-17
  * Micro controller = PIC 16F15344
  * 3v/5v SPI interface
  * Internal 170 volt SMPU
  * Really tiny
  * Super cute
